    <h1>MMMMM LASAGNA Method</h1>
<h2>
    <p>step 1
To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.
</p> <p>
step 2
Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
</p> <p>
step 3
Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.
</p> <p>
step 4
Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.
</p> <p>
step 5
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).
</p> <p>
step 6
Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
</p> <p>
step 7
Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.
</p> <p>
step 8
Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.
</p> <p>
step 9
Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</p></h2>
